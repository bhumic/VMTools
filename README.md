# FinSpy VM (v1.0 alpha)
Author: **ubnix**

FinSpyVM analysis tools for Binary Ninja (inspired by Rolf Rolles)

## Description:

This was inspired by the analysis of FinSpyVM made by [Rolf Rolles](http://www.msreverseengineering.com/blog/2018/1/23/a-walk-through-tutorial-with-code-on-statically-unpacking-the-finspy-vm-part-one-x86-deobfuscation)
I've decided to make or migrate as much of the [tools](https://github.com/RolfRolles/FinSpyVM) he used for the analysis of FinSpyVM into Binary Ninja. This plugin is mostly of educational purposes for me to learn more about:
 * Binary Ninja plugin development
 * Virtualization based executable protectors
 
The final goal is to make a set of functionality, as a Binary Ninja plugin, which might prove useful when analyzing various kinds of virtualization based protectors.
